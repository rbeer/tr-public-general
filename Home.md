Welcome to the home page for TR-Public

There are two options:

Option 1:
Use the `Code` section for the content
Users make PRs
Mods approve commits

Option 2: 
Use the `wiki` section
No option to make PRs on wiki
Users can submit issues, but wiki pages need to be created
Use Pages or other tool to render in to website
Integrate with Discord (https://github.com/Markus-Rost/discord-wiki-bot)


Readme.md should give instructions for how members can submit requests in either case.

Create basic structure. Create a dedicated TR user and transfer the repo over. Then enable pages and render as a website?
